You can check whether a string is a substring of another string by using the indexOf method 
in the String class. But here, you need to write your own method to achieve this task, i.e. 
a method called isSubstring to check whether this string is a substring of the parameter string.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two strings, invoke your method, check, and then
output whether the first string is a substring of the second.

notice: 

public boolean isSubString(String s){
		return j.contains(s);
	}
